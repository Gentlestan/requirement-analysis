#  Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is created to document the process and importance of requirement analysis in software development.  

Requirement analysis is the first and most crucial step in the software development lifecycle.  
The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Understand what requirement analysis is.  
- Highlight its role in ensuring successful projects.  
- Provide examples and documentation of best practices. 

## 1. What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of **gathering, analyzing, and defining** what a software system should do.  
It ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and shared understanding of the system‚Äôs **functionalities** and **performance expectations**.  

In the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), Requirement Analysis is the **foundation** that guides design, development, and testing.

## 2. Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is critical in SDLC because it:

- **Provides Clarity** ‚Äì Eliminates ambiguity by defining exactly what is needed.  
- **Defines Scope** ‚Äì Prevents scope creep and ensures focus on agreed features.  
- **Supports Cost & Time Estimation** ‚Äì Enables accurate planning of budget, resources, and timelines.  
- **Improves Quality** ‚Äì Ensures the final product meets user needs and expectations.  

## 3. Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The process involves five main activities:

- **Requirement Gathering** ‚Äì Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, or document analysis.  
- **Requirement Elicitation** ‚Äì Refining requirements using brainstorming, focus groups, and prototypes.  
- **Requirement Documentation** ‚Äì Writing requirements in structured formats such as user stories, use cases, or specification documents.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling** ‚Äì Prioritizing requirements, checking feasibility, and creating visual models (e.g., data flow diagrams).  
- **Requirement Validation** ‚Äì Reviewing with stakeholders, setting acceptance criteria, and ensuring traceability.  

## 4. Types of Requirements

### 4.1 Functional Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è
Functional requirements describe **what the system should do** ‚Äî the features and behaviors expected.  

**Examples for Booking Management System:**  
- Users can **search properties** based on location, price, and availability.  
- New users can **register** and create accounts with login credentials.  
- Display **property listings** with details and images.  
- Users can **book properties**, view bookings, and manage reservations.  
- Secure **user authentication** for login and registration.  

---

### 4.2 Non-functional Requirements üõ°Ô∏è
Non-functional requirements describe **how the system should perform** ‚Äî quality attributes like performance, security, or scalability.  

**Examples for Booking Management System:**  
- **Performance:** Pages should load within **2 seconds** and handle up to **1000 concurrent users**.  
- **Security:** All data must be **encrypted**; protect against common vulnerabilities.  
- **Scalability:** The system should **scale horizontally** to handle increasing traffic.  
- **Usability:** Provide an **intuitive interface** for easy navigation.  
- **Reliability:** Ensure **99.9% uptime** with quick recovery from failures.

## 5. Use Case Diagrams

### What is a Use Case Diagram?
A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation of the interactions between **users (actors)** and the **system**.  
It shows the **functional requirements** of a system at a high level by capturing **who does what**.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
- Provides a **clear overview** of system functionality.  
- Helps communicate requirements between **stakeholders and developers**.  
- Serves as a foundation for **test case design**.  
- Simplifies understanding of **system scope and user interactions**.  

### Example: Booking Management System
The diagram below illustrates how different actors (e.g., Guest, Admin) interact with the booking system.
