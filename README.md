#  Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is created to document the process and importance of requirement analysis in software development.  

Requirement analysis is the first and most crucial step in the software development lifecycle.  
The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Understand what requirement analysis is.  
- Highlight its role in ensuring successful projects.  
- Provide examples and documentation of best practices. 

## 1. What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of **gathering, analyzing, and defining** what a software system should do.  
It ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and shared understanding of the system’s **functionalities** and **performance expectations**.  

In the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), Requirement Analysis is the **foundation** that guides design, development, and testing.

## 2. Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is critical in SDLC because it:

- **Provides Clarity** – Eliminates ambiguity by defining exactly what is needed.  
- **Defines Scope** – Prevents scope creep and ensures focus on agreed features.  
- **Supports Cost & Time Estimation** – Enables accurate planning of budget, resources, and timelines.  
- **Improves Quality** – Ensures the final product meets user needs and expectations.  

## 3. Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The process involves five main activities:

- **Requirement Gathering** – Collecting information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, or document analysis.  
- **Requirement Elicitation** – Refining requirements using brainstorming, focus groups, and prototypes.  
- **Requirement Documentation** – Writing requirements in structured formats such as user stories, use cases, or specification documents.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling** – Prioritizing requirements, checking feasibility, and creating visual models (e.g., data flow diagrams).  
- **Requirement Validation** – Reviewing with stakeholders, setting acceptance criteria, and ensuring traceability.
